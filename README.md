# The Secure Electronic Health Records

This project represents a groundbreaking approach to healthcare data management, leveraging blockchain technology to revolutionize how medical information is stored, shared, and controlled. Built on the Ethereum blockchain and integrated with MetaMask for secure transactions, the system creates a robust, decentralized framework for electronic health records (SEHR).

At its core, the platform empowers patients with unprecedented control over their medical data. Through an intuitive interface, patients can securely upload health records, grant or revoke access permissions to healthcare providers, and maintain a comprehensive view of their medical history. This patient-centric approach ensures transparency while maintaining strict data privacy standards.

Healthcare providers benefit from streamlined access to patient information through a sophisticated permission system. Doctors can efficiently manage their patient roster, access authorized medical records, generate detailed consultation reports, and participate in a seamless medical information exchange. The system's integration with diagnostic centers enables the direct creation and sharing of EHR reports, fostering better coordination between all stakeholders in the healthcare journey.

The project's implementation of IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) ensures reliable, distributed storage of medical data, while Ganache provides a secure testing environment for blockchain transactions. This architectural approach not only enhances data security but also promotes interoperability between different healthcare systems and providers.

By combining blockchain's immutability with granular access controls, the platform creates a trustworthy ecosystem for health information exchange. This innovative solution addresses critical challenges in healthcare data management, ultimately leading to improved patient care, reduced administrative overhead, and better health outcomes through informed decision-making.

11.  Create an custom server on Metamask
    1. Name of the server I called SHR
     2. RPC Server is how ganache and Metamask will communicate its the server code on Ganache.
     3. Chain ID which will come up as soon as you enter some numbers
     4. Any currency symbol I used ETH
